Schneebrenner Homepage Repository
=================================

This is a repository hosting the source for my homepage at https://www.schneebrenner.de.

I started to create my homepage with the help of the static site generator [pelican](https://getpelican.com/) in order
to get rid of Wordpress as this is immoderate for a small private homepage.
As building the statice site with Pelican process also includes a build-step (like in software development)
and as I'm used to repositories as an software developer I decided to store the 'homepage sources' at github.

Further advantages are that I can track the changes and have it stored not just at my server and local computer (a kind of backup).

And last but not least I use this repository to get into the stuff of automated builds with help of [buildbot](https://www.buildbot.net/). I'm used to Jenkins but wanted to try out buildbot for such a long time. But this is another story worth to be documented in another repository - the homepage buildbot repository.

May be at the end this repository is not just handy for me but will also show how to setup a homepage with pelican - means beyond the quick start example.
